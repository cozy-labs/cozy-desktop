/**
 * This class is a producer: it watches the filesystem and the events are
 * created here.
 *
 * On Windows:
 *   the API used for FS notifications is ReadDirectoryChangesW. It is
 *   recursive and works without too many darts. Still, it doesn't detect the
 *   moves and atom/watcher can misunderstand renaming with just case swapping
 *   (Foo -> foo).
 *
 *   Another important thing to know is that we need to scan added directories: if
 *   the directory was restored from the trash or moved from outside the watched
 *   directory, ReadDirectoryChangesW won't send us events for the files and
 *   sub-directories.
 *
 * On Linux:
 *   the API used for FS notifications is inotify and is not recursive. It
 *   means that we have to add a watcher when we a new directory is added (and to
 *   remove a watcher when a watched directory is removed).
 *
 *   Even if inotify has a IN_ISDIR hint, atom/watcher does not report it. So, we
 *   have to call stat on the path to know if it's a file or a directory for add
 *   and update events.

   * Atom/watcher has a recursive option, even on Linux. It just calls inotify
   * on each sub-directory. Using this option has some pros and cons:
   *
   * - Pro: we don't have to explicitely manage the inotify watchers on Linux
   * - Pro: move/rename detection is made by atom/watcher on Linux
   * - Con: the sync dir must be scanned twice on Linux, once by atom/watcher
   *   to put the inotify watchers, and once by Producer for the initial scan
   * - Con: when a new directory is detected, we must scan it twice on Linux,
   *   once by atom/watcher to put inotify watchers on sub-directories that can
   *   have been added faster that the event has bubbled, and once by the local
   *   watcher (because it can be a directory that has been moved from outside
   *   the synchronized directory, and atom/watcher doesn't emit events in that
   *   case).
   *
   * As atom/watcher doesn't give use the inotify cookies, the move/rename
   * detection is probably the harder of the four tasks. So, we choosed to use
   * the recursive option.
