/** Ignored files/directories handling.
 *
 * Cozy-desktop can ignore some files and folders with a `.cozyignore` file. This
 * file is read only at the startup of Cozy-desktop. So, if this file is
 * modified, cozy-desktop has to be relaunched for the changes to be effective.
 *
 * There 4 places where ignoring files and folders can have a meaning:
 *
 * - when a change is detected on the local file system and cozy-desktop is going
 *   to save it in its internal pouchdb
 * - when a change is detected on the remote cozy and cozy-desktop is going to
 *   save it in its internal pouchdb
 * - when a change is taken from the pouchdb and cozy-desktop is going to apply
 *   on the local file system
 * - when a change is taken from the pouchdb and cozy-desktop is going to apply
 *   on the remote cozy.
 *
 * Even with the first two checks, pouchdb can have a change for an ignored file
 * from a previous run of cozy-desktop where the file was not yet ignored. So, we
 * have to implement the last two checks. It is enough for a file created on one
 * side (local or remote) won't be replicated on the other side if it is ignored.
 *
 * But, there is a special case: conflicts are treated ahead of pouchdb. So, if a
 * file is created in both the local file system and the remote cozy (with
 * different contents) is ignored, the conflict will still be resolved by
 * renaming if we implement only the last two checks. We have to avoid that by
 * also implementing at least one of the first two checks.
 *
 * In practice, it's really convenient to let the changes from the remote couchdb
 * flows to pouchdb, even for ignored files, as it is very costly to find them
 * later if `.cozyignore` has changed. And it's a lot easier to detect local
 * files that were ignored but are no longer at the startup, as cozy-desktop
 * already does a full scan of the local file system at that moment.
 *
 * Thus, cozy-desktop has a check for ignored files and folder in three of the
 * four relevant places:
 *
 * - when a change is detected on the local file system and cozy-desktop is going
 *   to save it in its internal pouchdb
 * - when a change is taken from the pouchdb and cozy-desktop is going to apply
 *   on the local file system
 * - when a change is taken from the pouchdb and cozy-desktop is going to apply
 *   on the remote cozy.
