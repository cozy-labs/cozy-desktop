/** The core of the synchronization.
 *
 * Metadata workflow
 * -----------------
 *
 * ![Workflow](../../doc/developer/workflow.png)
 *
 * Twake Desktop is a nodejs app, written in EcmaScript to be coherent with
 * other Twake Workplace apps. As its core, there is a pouchdb database used to
 * keep metadata about files and folders.
 *
 * On the remote Twake Workplace, the files and folders are saved in CouchDB.
 * Twake Desktop listens to the changes feed of CouchDB to be notified of all
 * the metadata changes on the remote Twake Workplace. Those metadata are
 * recopied in the local PouchDB.
 *
 * On the local filesystem, the synchronized folder is watched by the
 * {@link module:core/local/watcher|local watcher}. With it, Twake Desktop is
 * notified of all the changes on the file system and can update the pouchdb
 * with the new metadata.
 *
 * Twake Desktop also uses a changes feed on the local PouchDB. It takes
 * metadata changes one by one, and apply them to the other side. For example,
 * if the last modification date of a folder has changed on the remote Twake
 * Workplace, Twake Desktop will update it on the local filesystem.
 *
 * If a new file is added, Twake Desktop will ask one side to provide a nodejs
 * readable stream, and the other side will pipe it to its destination: a file
 * on the local filesytem, or a request to the files on the remote Twake
 * Workplace.
 *
 *
 * Conflicts
 * ---------
 *
 * Conflicts can happen. For example, when Twake Desktop is stopped, a file is
 * added on the remote Twake Workplace and a different file is added to the
 * local filesystem at the same path. When Twake Desktop will start, it will
 * detect that both the remote Twake Workplace instance and the local
 * filesystem have a file for the same path.
 *
 * The conflict resolution is very simple: one of those file is renamed with a
 * `-conflict` suffix. A more evolved solution would have been very hard to
 * secure. And bugs in this part mean losing data, which is very bad. So, we
 * don't try to be smart and prefer a robust solution.
 *
 *
 * Differences between file systems
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * In short, the file systems have some differences between Linux, BSD, OSX and
 * Windows. In short:
 *
 * - The path separator is `/` everywhere, except on Windows where it's `\ `.
 * - Linux and BSD file systems are sensible to the case, OSX and Windows are
 *   not (they preserve the original case, but they consider `foo` and `FOO` to
 *   be the same file).
 * - Linux and BSD use UTF-8 encoding for filenames, with no normalization.
 *   Windows uses UTF-16. OSX does something stupid: UTF-8 with a normalization
 *   that is nearly the unicode NFD, but not exactly.
 * - `/` and the NULL character are forbidden on all the OSes. On Windows, the
 *   list is longer: `"/\*?<>|:`.
 * - They are a bunch more restrictions on Windows:
 *   - the length of a path is limited to 260 characters
 *   - some names are reserved, like `AUX`, `COM1` or `LPT1`
 *   - a file or directory name cannot end with a space or a period.
 *
 * Node.js helps us a bit, but we are on our own for most of the things in this
 * list.
 *
 * For detecting conflicts, we need to know if two paths are the same. With the
 * issue of case sensitivity and NFD normalization, it's not as easy as it
 * seems. For Linux and BSD, we take the path and we put it in the `_id` field.
 * For Windows and OSX, we make the path upper case before putting it in `_id`
 * field. For OSX, we also does a string normalization on this field. Now, when
 * a new
 * file is added, we can check in pouchdb and see if another file has path that
 * will collide with this new path.
 *
 * So, even if `path` and `_id` are very similar, they have distinct roles:
 *
 * - `_id` is the normalized form and is used for comparison of paths
 * - `path` is the prefered form and used for actions on local file system and
 *   remote Twake Workplace.
 *
 * The permissions are different on Unix and on Windows. So, the `executable`
 * field is just ignored on Windows.
