# Log analysis

Debugging synchronization issues mostly means analysing logs.
Logs are in JSON lines format, generated by bunyan, and can be quite huge
(this is a known issue).

We use [jq][jq] to filter them. See [jq manual][jq/manual] to get all the
basic and advanced filters. A `yarn jq` script is also available which
automatically includes a bunch of custom ones:

    yarn jq 'some|filter' path/to/logs

The script doesn't use `--slurp` so JSON lines are filtered one by one and
memory usage is kept below 100MB. Which means you can filter multiple log
files at once, even huge ones:

    yarn jq 'some|filter' path/to/logs*

Start with the `issues` filter to find out main issues:

    yarn jq issues path/to/logs*

Shorten the output with *jq*'s `-c` option and the `short` filter so you get a
better overview:

    yarn jq -c 'issues|short' path/to/logs*

You can combine even more filters to focus on some kind of events:

    yarn jq -c 'issues|no_gui|xls|short' path/to/logs*

Then you can check what happened at some file path:

    yarn jq -c 'path(foo/bar)|short' path/to/logs*

Then get more details (e.g. dropping `-c` option and `short` filter):

    yarn jq 'select(...)' path/to/logs*

See the [`.jq`][.jq] file at the root of the repository to get the complete
list of custom filters.
